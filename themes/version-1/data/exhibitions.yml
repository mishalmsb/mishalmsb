  title: Egyptian Mummies and Eternal Life
  shortDescription: "<p>In collaboration with the noted Museo Egizio of Florence,
    Italy, this exhibition of some 100 exceptional original artifacts and exemplars,
    including mummies, painted sarcophagi, funeral trousseau and votive objects together
    with suggestive exhibition design and background graphics evokes the mythical,
    mysterious landscape of the tombs and pyramids of Ancient Egypt.&nbsp;</p><p>There,
    death was not considered the end of life. It was just the time of passing from
    one form of life to another that continued in the eternal afterlife, but the soul
    had to be prepared for this journey into immortality. The soul had to be reincarnated
    in its own body, which had to be preserved forever. This necessity led to the
    search for sophisticated methods of embalmment which was practiced by the ancient
    Egyptians from the very first dynasties of their millenniums of history. It also
    led to the placement of rich and varied funeral trousseaus in tombs in the belief
    that the soul of the deceased must be supplied with everything it might need to
    continue living in the afterlife.&nbsp;</p><p>The exhibition offers a particular
    focus on certain peculiarities of the funeral practices, particularly the process
    of mummification, a topic has long fascinated both experts and the general public
    from ancient times until today as demonstrated by popular culture. The exhibition
    perhaps dispels certain misconceptions by offering a clear explanation that all
    the funeral rituals, even the most macabre, did not serve to simply preserve the
    body of the deceased, but rather to insure the continuation of life beyond the
    grave.</p>"

  title: Golden Mummies of Egypt
  shortDescription: "<h1><strong>Glittering gold and mysterious mummies are among
    Ancient Egypt’s most iconic and popular attractions. Golden Mummies of Egypt presents
    eight extraordinary mummies and also explores beliefs about the afterlife when
    Egypt was part of the Greek and Roman worlds.</strong></h1><p>Centred on eight
    mummies from the Manchester Museum’s world-class collection, this exhibition offers
    an insight into the hopes and fears of the wealthy in society. Those who could
    afford the expensive process of mummification hoped to cheat death. This ancient
    ritual harnessed the protective power of a range of Egypt’s many gods to immortalise
    the deceased. By being covered in gold, the Egyptians hoped to imitate the eternal
    radiance of the gods themselves.</p><p>The University of Manchester has led research
    on Egyptian mummies for over a century, having acquired many of its objects from
    archaeological excavations. Innovative visualisation technology is used to bring
    cutting-edge CT-scans to life. Importantly, the exhibition also asks why we are
    fascinated by mummies and what they might tell us about ourselves.</p><p>The exhibition
    includes 360 degree interactive CT-scans of each mummy on display, allowing the
    visitor to see beneath the wrappings; audio-visual translations of texts bring
    the words of ancient people to life; iconographic visualisations animate the gods
    the Egyptians hoped to meet.</p><h2><strong>Exhibition specifications</strong></h2><h3><strong>Curatorial
    partners</strong></h3><p>Manchester Museum, part of the University of Manchester</p><h3>Collection</h3><p>This
    spectacular exhibition consists of over 100 key objects from the Manchester Museum
    collection, including mummies, masks, coffins, jewellery and sculpture.</p><h3>Exhibition
    themes</h3><p>In a series of lavishly illustrated thematic sections the exhibition
    uses the outstanding collections of Manchester Museum to allow visitors to examine
    life for the wealthy in multicultural Roman Egypt, where diverse Egyptian, Roman
    and Greek communities and cultural influences were blended.</p><p>The exhibition
    journey traces expectations for the afterlife and introduces cultural constructions
    of identity, strikingly demonstrated by the haunting painted panel portraits,
    the Manchester collection of which are amongst the finest in the world, placed
    over the face of some Roman Period mummies. As spectacularly shown by the mummies
    on display, the practises of preservation and decoration of the body, and the
    transformation of the deceased into a god are also explored.</p>"

  title: 'Tombs of the Liao Dynasty: Treasures from the Afterlife'
  shortDescription: "<h1>Step into the ancient tombs of Inner Mongolia to discover
    the forgotten story of an extraordinary civilisation. Illustrated with stunning
    original artefacts intricately crafted in gold and silver the exhibition also
    introduces us to the mysterious Liao Princess of Chen.</h1><p>Tombs of the Liao
    Dynasty unearths the little-known history of an enigmatic dynasty that ruled over
    a large part of East Asia 907–1125 AD: the Liao dynasty.</p><p>The Liao dynasty
    was founded by an ancient nomadic group known as the Khitan.&nbsp;Until recently
    the Liao and its nomadic founders were a neglected and misunderstood chapter of
    Chinese and Inner Asian history. Following ground-breaking recent discoveries
    of tombs across Inner Mongolia and Northern China, these perceptions have been
    transformed and the sophistication, creativity and refinement of this extraordinary
    ancient civilisation have been revealed.</p><p>Bringing to light over 120 remarkable
    treasures from museums across Inner Mongolia, the exhibition is an immersive journey
    of archaeological and artistic discovery which offers a unique encounter with
    powerful characters and a fascinating lost culture.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Exhibition
    specifications</h2><h3>Curatorial partners</h3><p>Inner Mongolia Museum, China</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Collection</h3><p>Over
    120 original artefacts from China, including an exceptional number of national
    treasures.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3>Exhibition themes</h3><h4>Women of the
    Liao Dynasty</h4><p>The role of women in the Liao dynasty will form a recurring
    theme throughout the exhibition. Supported with objects, images and written sources,
    we will explore the considerable freedom enjoyed by women, and the striking contrast
    which this presented to the position of Han Chinese women.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>A
    Nomadic Tradition</h4><p>The Khitan were a nomadic tribe from eastern Mongolia,
    a fertile land of mountains and rolling grasslands which centred upon the Liao
    River. Herding cattle and horses was the central pillar of their nomadic way of
    life and warfare; hunting and falconry were key facets of Khitan hunter-warrior
    culture.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>Daily Life</h4><p>What was it like to live
    in the Liao empire? Here we will look at where people lived, the structure of
    society, what people did for amusement and celebration, the music they created,
    how they travelled, traded and the clothing they wore throughout the great Liao
    dynasty.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>Inspiration and Influence</h4><p>The Liao
    came to control a vast territory which expanded from northern China to present
    day Mongolia and Manchuria. The Khitan chose aspects of other cultures while retaining
    their own cultural identity. This theme will examine the careful balancing act
    between new inspirations and ancient traditions.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>Ritual
    and Religion</h4><p>Traditionally the belief system of the Khitan people was Shamanism.
    Shamanists worshipped mountains, the sun and moon, Heaven, Earth, rivers and animals.
    By the eleventh century Buddhism came to penetrate Liao society and began a golden
    age in belief among members of the Imperial household.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>Death
    and the Afterlife</h4><p>Many Khitan traditions were merged with Chinese burial
    practices. Diverging from Chinese traditions, Khitan burial was accompanied by
    death masks, burial suits, animal and sometimes human sacrifice. The Khitan also
    buried entire houses with the deceased, using them as vast coffins within the
    tomb.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h4>Tomb of the Princess</h4><p>In 1985 archaeologists
    discovered the first ever royal Khitan tomb which had been left untouched since
    the Liao period. The epitaph within told them that the tomb dated to 1018 and
    belonged to the Princess of Chen and her husband. At the heart of the exhibition,
    this groundbreaking discovery will be revealed to visitors, displaying the original
    artefacts excavated from the burial tomb.</p>"
